		<h1> About EveryUse </h1>
		<p>
			EveryUse is the new platform particularly designed for sharing cases of artifact appropriation.
			However, EveryUse not only involves sharing and viewing; it also includes other activities,
			such as commenting and "scrapping" (saving or bookmarking) others' cases, and "following"
			other participants. EveryUse is developed as an Android application, to run on an
			Android device with an OS version higher than 2.3.3 (Gingerbread), so that people could
			download EveryUse from Google Play and install it on an Android-based mobile phone.
		</p>
		<h2> Sharing cases of appropriation </h2>
		<p>
			EveryUse enables people to describe an item they used and the purpose for which they
			used it and upload a picture of the case of appropriation. Limiting the description of purpose
			enables the platform to form categories of purpose by simplifying its expression and diminishes
			people's efforts to describe it.
		</p>
		<h2> Viewing others' cases </h2>
		<p>
			EveryUse supports viewing others' cases in five tabs: Top, Recent, Feed, Category, and My
			use. In the list of Top, the highly ranked cases are shown according to two comments: Wow
			and Me-too. You can view the most admired cases and the most sympathized with cases in
			the Top view. Shared cases are also listed in chronological order on the Recent tab. You can
			check newly uploaded cases as well as expose your own case to other participants after uploading.
			The cases that are uploaded by followees ("followee" refers to someone whom the
			user is following) are listed in chronological order in the list of Feed. The Category view displays
			the categories of items and purposes grouping identical expressions of items and purposes.
			The categories are sorted alphabetically by item and purpose. The Category view
			also supports a search function through which you can search for a certain item or purpose.
			In My use, you can view the cases you shared and those on which you commented or
			scrapped.
